<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

All credits for this method go to https://bionic-reading.com/ and @itorr

Bionic Reading is a new method facilitating the rading process by guiding the eyes through text with artificial fixation points.
As a result, the reader is only focusing on the highlighted initial letters and lets the brain center complete the word.

Percs:
* Does NOT break links
* Refresh page to restore original text
* Simple & Easy to use

### Usage

Launch Chrome >> Settings >> Extensions >> (Enable 'Developer mode') >> Load unpacked >> Select parent folder of extension
